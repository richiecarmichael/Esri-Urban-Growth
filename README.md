Click [here](http://maps.esri.com/rc/urban/index.html) to view the live application.

Inspiration and data for this app was derived from [Tertius Chandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertius_Chandler)'s 1987 book entitled [Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth: An Historical Census](http://mellenpress.com/mellenpress.cfm?bookid=4252&pc=9). Chandler's work was merged and updated with data from [Esri](http://www.esri.com/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
